    "I am currently using my COVID-19 imposed quarantine to expand my deep learning skills by completing the [*Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree*](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). This past week I have been working my way through the seminal 2015 *Nature* paper from researchers at [Deepmind](https://deepmind.com/) [*Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning*](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) (Minh et al 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Minh et al 2015 important?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Minh et al 2015 was not the first paper to use neural networks to approximate the action-value function, this paper was the first to demonstrate that the same neural network architecture could be trained in a computationally efficient manner to \"solve\" a large number or different tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper also contributed several practical \"tricks\" for getting deep neural networks to consistently converge during training. This was a non-trivial contribution as issues with training convergence had plaugued previous attempts to use neural networks as function approximators in reinforcement learning tasks and were blocking widespread adoption of deep learning techniques within the reinforcemnt learning community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Minh et al 2015 uses deep (convolutional) neural network to approximate the optimal action-value function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q^*(s, a) = \\max_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E}\\Bigg[\\sum_{s=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^s r_{t+s} | s_t=s, a_t=a, \\pi \\Bigg] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the maximum sum of rewards $r_t$ discounted by $\\gamma$ at each time-step $t$ achievable by a behaviour policy $\\pi = P(a|s)$, after making an observation of the state $s$ and taking an action $a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to this seminal paper it was well known that standard reinforcement learning algorithms were unstable or even diverged when a non-linear function approximators such as a neural networks were used to represent the action-value function $Q$. Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "Minh et al 2015 discuss several reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correlations present in the sequence of observations of the state $s$. In reinforcement learning applications the sequence state observations is a time-series which will almost surely be auto-correlated. But surely this would also be true of any application of deep neural networks to model time series data. \n",
    "2. Small updates to $Q$ may significantly change the policy, $\\pi$ and therefore change the data distribution.\n",
    "3. Correlations between the action-values, $Q$, and the target values $r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper the authors address these issues by using...\n",
    "\n",
    "* a biologically inspired mechanism they refer to as *experience replay* that randomizes over the data which removes correlations in the sequence of observations of the state $s$ and smoothes over changes in the data distribution (issues 1 and 2 above).\n",
    "* an iterative update rule that adjusts the action-values, $Q$, towards target values, $Q'$ that are only periodically updated thereby reducing correlations with the target (issue 3 above)."

    "In this environment the landing pad is always at coordinates (0,0). The reward for moving the lander from the top of the screen to landing pad and arriving at zero speed is typically between 100 and 140 points. Firing the main engine is -0.3 points each frame (so the lander is incentivized to fire the engine as few times possible). If the lander moves away from landing pad it loses reward (so the lander is incentived to land in the designated landing area). The lander is also incentived to land \"gracefully\" (and not crash in the landing area!).\n",

    "A training episode finishes if the lander crashes (-100 points) or comes to rest (+100 points). Each leg with ground contact receives and additional +10 points. The task is considered \"solved\" if the lander is able to achieve 200 points (I will actually be more stringent and define \"solved\" as achieving over 200 points on average in the most recent 100 training episodes).\n",

    "\n",
    "In the DQN algorithm the agent chooses its action using an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy. When using an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy, with probability $\\epsilon$, the agent explores the state space by choosing an action uniformly at random from the set of feasible actions; with probability $1-\\epsilon$, the agent exploits its current knowledge by choosing the optimal action given that current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent learns and acquires additional knowledge about it environment it makes sense to *decrease* exploration and *increase* exploitation by decreasing $\\epsilon$. In practice, it isn't a good idea to decrease $\\epsilon$ to zero; instead one typically decreases $\\epsilon$ over time according to some schedule until it reaches some minimum value.\n",

    "Kernel density plot of scores is bimodal with one mode less than -100 and a second mode greater than 200. The negative mode corresponds to those training episodes where the agent crash landed and thus scored at most -100; the positive mode corresponds to those training episodes where the agent \"solved\" the task. The kernel density or scores typically exhibits negative skewness (i.e., a fat left tail): there are lots of ways in which landing the lander can go horribly wrong (resulting in the agent getting a very low score) and only relatively few paths to a gentle landing (and a high score)."

    "I am a bit frustrated by lack of stability that I am seeing in my implmentation of the Deep Q algorithm: sometimes the algorithm converges and sometimes not. Perhaps more tuning of hyper-parameters or use of a different optimization algorithm would exhibit better convergence. I have already spent more time than I had allocated on playing around with this agorithm so I am not going to try and fine-tune the hyperparamters or explore alternative optimization algorithms for now.\n",
